                        <h3>Climatec to Varitec. A 40-year legacy of leadership.</h3>
                        <p>Earlier this year, privately held Robert Bosch, GmbH, a global entity with more than 270,000 employees and similar core values of excellence and integrity, completed the acquisition of Climatec’s Building Technology Group (BTG). As Bosch and BTG take the “Climatec brand” forward and expand the geographic footprint of that business, Climatec’s Engineered HVAC Solutions equipment business is taking this opportunity to “re-brand” ourselves while retaining our rifle focus on the customers and the markets we serve. </p>

                        <p>Founded in Phoenix 40 years ago, Climatec grew to more than 850 employees with 13 locations in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. The foundation of our growth and success was to provide world-class products and services to assure our clients of the best possible owning experience. Easy to say, difficult to execute. Climatec’s margin of excellence is our people. We’ve attracted and retained the industry’s top talent by empowering our people with the authority, work environment and the tools required to place the customer first and deliver on our promise of a great owning experience.</p>
                        <p class="center"><em>“Our unique 40-year legacy of leadership in Engineered HVAC Solutions, blended with our industry-leading experts and world-leading products is the foundation of Varitec’s success. Since 1975 our passion has remained the same:. to make buildings more efficient and more comfortable for our clients.”</em></p>
