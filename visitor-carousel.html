            <h3>Climatec to Varitec</h3>
            <h3>A 40-year legacy of excellence and leadership.</h3>
            <p class="left-justify">Earlier this year, Germany based Robert Bosch, GmbH, a global entity with more than 270,000 employees and similar core values of excellence and integrity, completed the acquisition of Climatec’s Building Technology Group (BTG).  As Bosch and BTG take the “Climatec brand” forward and expand the geographic footprint of that business, Climatec’s Engineered HVAC Solutions equipment business is taking this opportunity to “re-brand” ourselves while retaining our rifle focus on the customers and the markets we serve.</p>

            <h3>Same Legacy. New Name.</h3>
            <p class="left-justify">Founded in Phoenix 40 years ago, Climatec grew to more than 850 employees with 13 locations in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas.  The foundation of our growth and success was to provide world class products and services to assure our clients of the best possible owning experience.  Easy to say, difficult to execute.  Climatec’s margin of excellence – our people.  We’ve attracted and retained the industry’s top talent by empowering our people with the authority, work environment and the tools required to place the customer first and deliver on our promise of a great owning experience.</p>
            <p class="left-justify">Though our name is changing, our company will not.  Same team.  Same passion.  Same legacy.</p>
